# the_beginning
anything and everyting


This repository should be the introduction to my private adventures into a world of digitalization.
A free arena to express my thoughts, develope ideas, and attempt to solve problems reaching further 
then my nose. There will also be a few txt files with updates on mental development, exploring the
curiosities that plauge my everyday life. The meaning for this profile should be to sepearate potentially
harmful ideas from the professional repository I'm building through school and work. This repository
should be viewed as a playground, where everything goes; even those stupid code ideas I never got to work. 
Maybe someone will stumble upon them and become inspired to make them correctly. As long as the idea 
further's the development in the world, I can't be mad about stolen intellect. Nothing is this life 
is ever truely stolen, since there is always a chance to give it back. Although, the true motto of 
life should be to pay it forward.
